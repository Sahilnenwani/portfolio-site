# Event-Driven Architecture with Kafka

Apache Kafka has become the backbone of modern distributed systems. Let's explore how to implement resilient event-driven patterns.

## Why Kafka?

- Durability: Messages are persisted to disk
- Scalability: Horizontal scaling with partitions
- Ordering: Guaranteed order within partitions
- Replay: Consumers can replay events

## Implementation Examples

Coming soon with detailed code examples...
