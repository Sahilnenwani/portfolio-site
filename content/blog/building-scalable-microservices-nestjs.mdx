# Building Scalable Microservices with NestJS

Building scalable microservices is a critical skill for modern backend developers. In this article, we'll explore how to architect and implement microservices using NestJS.

## Why NestJS for Microservices?

NestJS provides a solid foundation for building microservices with its modular architecture, built-in dependency injection, and transport layer abstraction.

## The Outbox Pattern

One of the most important patterns for reliable event publishing is the Outbox Pattern...

```typescript
@Injectable()
export class OrderService {
  @Transactional()
  async createOrder(dto: CreateOrderDto): Promise<Order> {
    const order = await this.orderRepository.create(dto);
    await this.outboxRepository.create({
      aggregateId: order.id,
      eventType: 'ORDER_CREATED',
      payload: order,
    });
    return order;
  }
}
```
