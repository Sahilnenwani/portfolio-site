# Go vs Node.js: When to Use What

Both Go and Node.js are excellent choices for backend development, but they shine in different scenarios.

## Performance Benchmarks

In our tests migrating an import service from Node.js to Go, we saw:
- 60% faster processing for CPU-intensive operations
- Lower memory footprint for concurrent operations
- Better garbage collection predictability

## When to Choose Go

Go is ideal for high-performance data processing, system-level programming, and services requiring predictable latency.

## When to Choose Node.js

Node.js is ideal for API gateways, real-time applications, and rapid prototyping.
